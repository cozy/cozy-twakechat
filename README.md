## What is it

cozy-twakechat is a container app that embeds [Twake Chat](https://github.com/linagora/twake-on-matrix) app. It is a very basic app displaying the cozy-bar and an iframe. By leveraging [cozy-external-bridge](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-libs/tree/master/packages/cozy-external-bridge), it allows history syncing from Twake Chat and exposes APIs to Twake Chat.

## Install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-twakechat.git
$ cd cozy-twakechat
$ yarn install
```
